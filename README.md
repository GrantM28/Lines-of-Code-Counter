# Lines of Code Counter (CLOC)

CLOC is a simple application that counts lines of code in specified file extensions within a directory. The application has been packaged as a standalone executable, so Python installation is not required.

## Usage

1. Run the executable (`CLOC.exe` on Windows) by double-clicking it.
2. Enter the file extensions separated by spaces in the entry box.
3. Click "Select Directory" to choose the directory to scan.
4. The application will display the total lines of code and breakdown by file extension.
